Custom FieldBox Plugin
======================

This WordPress plugin was created for usage in http://www.toolkit.so, a developer tools reference. It's purpose is to take custom fields assigned to a post and render them using a widget. The widget will only display if on a single post page and outputs the custom values as an HTML table. You can customize this table to match your sites theme by editing the *css/theme.css* file.

This Plugin is still in a development phase and not recommended for production use. If you discover any bugs, please report them.
